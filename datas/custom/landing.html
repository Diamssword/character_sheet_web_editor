<div>
    <p>This is an exemple landing page, to display it at the root of the website, rename this file to "landing.html", the html inside will be automaticly rendered.</p>

    <p>If the file is not present, the page will redirect the user to /editor</p>
    <p>You can of course also modify +page.svelte if needed, but you will have to recompile from source yourself.</p>
    <a href="/editor" style="color:blueviolet;">[To the editor]</a>
